# CognitivePresence_Cnn_XAI
## Intro
 This repo is an experiment to use the Inception Convolutional Neural Network to classify the phases of cognitive presence in online discussions from two courses data. The eXplainable AI, SmoothGrad method from the iNNvestigate(https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate), was applied to visualise the importance of words and phrases in the discussion messages for predicting each cognitive phase.

## Notes
- Please download and include the 100d pre-trained Glove model(https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) in the repo when running our code.
- Currently, our training and testing data cannot be shared publicly due to some ethical issues. We are trying our best to build an open database for researchers who are interested at the Community of Inquiry frameworks. 
- Welcome to either train a CNN model by using your own dataset or load the best-performing models from us. The best models were provided in the best_weights folder.
- TensorFlow 1.x is recommended for this experiment.
